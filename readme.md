# OCR Detection (individual characters)
This script uses pytesseract to identify specific letters in an image, not a whole string. This is useful for identifying letters in images, or automating word games...
Check out main.py for an annotated script that you can use in any way for your own projects.

I found using pytesseract to be a real struggle to extract individual letters reliably, but this is about as dialed in and tuned up script I could write and it seems quite accurate.

Here is a quick demo showing the results and accuracy of this script...
